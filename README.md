# RPi-Alkalinity
Total Alkalinity measurement with Raspberry Pi for inexpensive and open-source science.  

This repository provides the software and schematics necessary to construct an instrument for the measurement of Total Alkalinity in seawater or freshwater.  This design aims to fulfill several goals:

1) Open source software.
2) Cost minimization.
3) Fulfillment of the "weather" goals for uncertainty in alkalinity measurement as specified by Newton et al. (2015).  

This design will be associated with a scientific publication, and should not be disseminated to the public in any form.
