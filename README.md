# RPi-Alkalinity
Total Alkalinity measurement with Raspberry Pi for inexpensive and open-source science.  

This repository provides the software and schematics necessary to construct an instrument for the measurement of Total Alkalinity in seawater and freshwater.  This design aims to fulfill several goals:

1) Open source software.
2) Cost minimization.
3) Fulfillment of the "weather" goals for uncertainty in total alkalinity measurement specified by [Newton et al. (2015).  ](http://goa-on.org/documents/general/GOA-ON_2nd_edition_final.pdf)

This design is associated with a peer-reviewed scientific publication accepted for publication in Limnology and Oceanography: Methods.  A link to the finalized manuscript (which includes details on assembly) will be included here when it is publically available.
